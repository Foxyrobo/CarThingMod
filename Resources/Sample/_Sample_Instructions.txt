	Welcome to the custom car creator! Here, you can add any image you'd like as a custom car!

Instructions:

	1. Add any .png image to the cars folder (so not this folder, but the one below it)
	2. Add a .txt file with the same name as the image
	  Ex: "coolCar.png" and "coolCar.txt"
	3. Format the .txt file the same way that the "Sample_Car.txt" is formatted. This is the settings file for the car (more info below).

Settings:

	Each car should have a settings file with the same name as the image (explained in parts 2 and 3 in the instructions up above).
	The following settings can be changed:

	1. colXSize - The horizontal size of the car's collider. Every car uses a basic BoxCollider2D. Default: 1.2
	2. colYSize - The vertical size of the car's collider. Default: 0.7
	3. colXOffset - How far off from the center of the car should the collider be (on the X axis). Default: 0
	4. colYOffset - How far off from the center of the car should the collider be (on the Y axis). Default: 0
	5. pixelsPerUnit - How many pixels (horizontally and vertically) should occupy one unit of space. Default: 64
